            <p>
                My name's Daniel Hudson, I'm an aspiring programmer with a lot of ideas. If I find a problem, I'll find a solution. 
                Sometimes it's a bit outlandish, but my solutions usually work.
                I may not always see the most direct solution, but I'll solve the issue. I work well with otheres who work with me. I like the idea of a team not having a set "leader" but a group of equals working together.
                I try and be the big brother in the group, helping keep everyone going. If the going gets rough, I try and find a better road.</p>
